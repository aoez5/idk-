      I'm an 18-year-old aspiring Web Developer with a growing interest in Backend Development. <br><br>
      I'm currently learning and building projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a beginner, I'm passionate about improving my skills and creating clean, functional websites. Every line of code I write is a step forward in my journey as a developer. <br><br>
      Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and turn ideas into reality!
